# Machine Configuration Information

This contains different settings and configuration items for my ThinkPadZ16 laptop. This machine has had so many problems and I've needed to re-image or replace it 5 times since Aug 2022. UGH!

I run the [Refresh-Files.ps1](Refresh-Files.ps1) every once in a while to update all of the files that are in this backup.

Also need to run scripts from `https://github.com/MattRyanCo/Dev-Drive` to initialize dev drive. Specifically:
- SetupDevDrive.ps1
- SetDevDriveOwner.ps1
- SetupDevDrivePackageCache.ps1

Replacing original devdrive.ps1 in this repo with the more advanced options in https://github.com/MattRyanCo/Dev-Drive
